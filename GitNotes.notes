In order to open the directory that you're currently in the terminal just type (start .) and it will open in file explorer sometimes it can be very useful.
To move/copy a file or folder to the parent directory you can use the command mv (fileName.ext ..) or cp (fileName.ext ..).
Instead of just writing ls you can even write ls folderName/path (A random folder in current directory or even a path for that matter) it will show it's contents too.h
You can use git add directoryName too incase you want to add an entire directory to the staging area.
One good practice to go by is making commits atomic basically make commits that focus on one feature of whatever but don't make commits that change a lot of files in lots of things and have not much of a relation with each other that will cause a lot of issues if you revert a commit.
